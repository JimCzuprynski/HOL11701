### Community-Contributed Workshop

* **Author:** Jim Czuprynski, Oracle ACE Director, Zero Defect Computing, Inc.

This LiveLab session explores a real-world business scenario: Your company's latest social media campaign promoting a new product release suddenly trends negative after initial positive uptake. Your social media manager must quickly determine if the negative trend is feedback from real customers or the result of organized trolling activity.

We will take advantage of Oracle 23ai's new Operational Property Graphs (OPGs) and use simple SQL statements to analyze influencers and their activities in real time to determine sources of positive and negative feedback. We will also use the GraphViz Toolkit (GVT) plugin within a simple APEX application to visually explore the relationships between influencers and trolls, as well as the messaging they have created.

Note: To gain the most from these labs, you should be familiar with basic Oracle Database concepts. Knowledge and understanding of graph database concepts is helpful, but not required.

### Objectives
In this lab, you will learn how to:
- Create an Oracle 23ai Autonomous Database.
- Create and populate database objects in SQL Developer Web.
- Create an Operational Property Graph (OPGs) and query it for meaningful answers and business solutions.
- Configure an APEX workspace and import an existing APEX application.
- Visualize OPG queries within an APEX application via the GraphViz Toolkit (GVT) plug-in.
